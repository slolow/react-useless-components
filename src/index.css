/* tailwindcss v4 sets by default the light/dark theme from your system (@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark))
with the next line we switch it to set the light dark theme depending on whether the class="dark" is in the html element
or not.
We do so, because the @storybook/addon-themes relies on this.
This means users of the component system have to set their dark mode by adding a class="dark" to html.
They can also implement a three way (light, dark, system)
