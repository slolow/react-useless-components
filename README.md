## 📦 Usage (For Library Users)

### 1️⃣ Importing components

Each component is exported from the library root:

```jsx
import { UselessButton } from "react-useless-components";

const MyButton = () => {
  return <UselessButton label="Click me" />;
};
```

#### Styles

The library automatically loads its own Tailwind CSS bundle,
so consumers do **NOT** need to install Tailwind just to use it.

### 2️⃣ Dark Mode Support (Tailwind v4)

This library supports Tailwind v4’s dark mode behavior.

👉 Tailwind v4 does NOT use darkMode: "class" anymore.
👉 Instead, it uses CSS variants, and this library already includes one:

@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark \*));

This means:

✔ If your app sets

```html
<html lang="en" class="dark"></html>
```

all dark: styles inside the library’s components get activated.

### 3️⃣ How to toggle between light, dark, and system mode

Based on: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually

```javascript
// On page load or when changing themes, best to add inline in `head` to avoid FOUC
document.documentElement.classList.toggle(
  "dark",
  localStorage.theme === "dark" ||
    (!("theme" in localStorage) &&
      window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches),
);
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses light mode
localStorage.theme = "light";
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses dark mode
localStorage.theme = "dark";
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses to respect the OS preference
localStorage.removeItem("theme");
```

simple toggle for three way switch ("light", "dark", "system")

```javascript
const toggleTheme = (mode: "light" | "dark" | "system") => {
  const root = document.documentElement;

  if (mode === "light") {
    root.classList.remove("dark");
    localStorage.theme = "light";
  }

  if (mode === "dark") {
    root.classList.add("dark");
    localStorage.theme = "dark";
  }

  if (mode === "system") {
    root.classList.remove("dark");
    localStorage.removeItem("theme");
  }
}
```

## 🛠 Developer Guide (For Contributors)

This section is for people who want to clone, contribute, or develop the library.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/react-useless-components.git
cd react-useless-components
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run Storybook (development mode)

The recommended way to develop components is inside Storybook. To run storybook you will need the correct node version to be installed.
The project node version is defined in the .nvmrc file.

Just run

```bash
nvm use
```

to use the project version.

Once the correct node version is installed run the storybook like this:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This includes:

- Hot reload
- Live Tailwind updates
- Dark/light theme support
- Component playground

### 4️⃣ Building the library

To produce the library bundle (ESM, CJS, CSS):

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs are written to:

```
dist/
├── index.js
├── index.cjs
├── index.d.ts
├── react-useless-components.css
└── components/
```

### 5️⃣ Type checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This uses the root tsconfig.json for consistent type safety.

### 6️⃣ Project Architecture

```
react-useless-components/
│
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts                       # library entry point
│   ├── index.css                      # Tailwind v4 + custom dark variant
│   └── components/
│       ├── UselessButton/
│       │   ├── UselessButton.tsx
│
├── .storybook/
│   ├── main.ts                        # Storybook config
│   ├── preview.ts                     # Global decorators (theme toggling)
│   └── stories/                       # MDX / docs pages
│       │── UselessButton.stories.tsx  # Storybook
│
├── vite.config.ts                     # Build config (library mode)
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.lib.json
└── package.json
```

#### Key Design Decisions

Vite is used for fast dev & library builds.

Tailwind v4 is used without requiring the user to install Tailwind.

Storybook powers component development and documentation.

TypeScript ensures type-safe components.

CSS is auto-loaded so users don’t manually import styles.

### 7️⃣ Publishing (maintainers only)

Build the package:

```bash
npm run build
```

Publish:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Ensure you are logged into npm:

```bash
npm login
```
